# Integration_Project
- This was the very first program that I created for my COP 1500 class. It is essentially a calculator to find the mesurments of different ingredients depending on the desired number of serving sizes.
- Feel free to modify the code in order to improve effeciency, readability, while adhering to the PEP 8 standard. When I wrote wrote this program I had limited knowlege of Python and best coding practices so there is definitely room for improvement.
- If you have any recommendations on how to improve this project please send an email to gymayo7393@eagle.fgcu.edu
